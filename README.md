# Overview

This project defines the various material necessary to understand, design, and build a...

Well, a Trebuchet. Huh. Yeah, that seems about right.

## Description

It's a trebuchet, innit? But seriously:

The `science` subproject defines jupyter notebook files which describe the various physics
mechanisms we have to worry about. It does this in note form because this is as much a
research project as a simulation / design one.

The `schematics` subproject defines a set of design components for the various parts we
need.

For further documentation please refer to individual subprojects as necessary.
